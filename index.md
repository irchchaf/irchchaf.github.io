### [self-supervised deep learning for beam prediction in mmWave networks](/sample_page)
Beam prediction in dynamic mmWave networks is a challenging task. In this project, self-supervised deep learning is leveraged to predict, based on sub-6 GHz channels data, mmWave beams in an access-point/receiver link and optimize the data rate. The trained neural network exploits the channel data at the input to output the beamforming vector for the mmWave band.

### Federated Learning for beam prediction in multi-link mmWave networks
In a multi-link network, a federated learning scheme is proposed to predict the mmWave beamforming vectors locally, at each access-point. Federated learning consists in sharing  local models with a server, which can aggregate them into a more informed global model for all links, leading to better performance without sharing their local data. In this project, we investigate both synchronous and asynchronous modes of uploading of the local models, and compare their performance to centralized learning.
