[self-supervised deep learning for beam prediction in mmWave networks](/sample_page)
Beam prediction in dynamic mmWave networks is a challenging task. In this project, self-supervised deep learning is leveraged to predict, starting from sub-6 GHz channels data, mmWave beams in an access-point -- receiver link to optimize the data rate.
