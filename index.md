### Self-supervised deep learning for beam prediction in mmWave networks
Beam prediction in dynamic mmWave networks is a challenging task. In this project, self-supervised deep learning is leveraged to predict, based on sub-6 GHz channels data, mmWave beams in one access-point/receiver link and optimize the data rate. The trained neural network exploits the channel data at the input to output the beamforming vector for the mmWave band.

### Federated Learning for beam prediction in multi-link mmWave networks
In a multi-link network, a federated learning scheme is proposed to predict the mmWave beamforming vectors locally, at each access-point. Federated learning consists in sharing  local models with a server, which can aggregate them into a more informed global model for all links, leading to better performance without sharing their local data. In this project, we investigate both synchronous and asynchronous modes of uploading of the local models, and compare their performance to centralized learning.

### SpaceX Falcon 9 first stage Landing Prediction
This project is the final project of the IBM Data Science professional certificate on Coursera. It exploits machine learning  tools to  predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. The project involves collecting data, Exploratory Data Analysis, data vizualisation, feature engineering, SQL queries and prediction using different estimators. The machine learning pipeline allows to predict the sucess of the first stage landing, which reduces the launch cost.

### Classification and Regression
This projects contains notebooks of regression and classification problems. The first notebook represents a classification problem to predict whether a patient is infected with covid-19 or not. The second notebook aims to predict a diamond price using tabular regression. It contains two main parts: EDA and price prediction.
